Ansible i a configuration management

configuring a control server with worker nodes

create 3 server and make one of them control
on the control node edit tenable password authenthication under the sshd_config file within the ssh directory

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/ 

STEPS for the Configuration of CONTROL and WORKER NODES

1. Create 3 EC2 Instances
-> Make one as Control node and other two servers as worker-1 and worker-2

2. Login to the COntrol node and make the changes in sshd_config
-> cd /etc/ssh
-> ll
-> vi sshd_config
# PasswordAuthentication yes (Enable)

3. Restart the sshd
-> systemctl restart sshd
-> systemctl status sshd
4. Install ANSIBLE on the CONTROL NODE
-> amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y

4. Install ANSIBLE and Python-pip on the CONTROL NODE
-> amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y
-> yum install python python-pip python-dlevel -y

5. Add the IP address of the Worker-nodes in the Ansible-hosts file which is present on Control Node
-> cd /etc/ansible
-> ll
-> vi hosts
# ADD the IP addresses of both the Worker-nodes

6. Two Approaches for installing packages/running services

a) Install softwares/packages using ADHOC Commands (manually)
b) Install softwares/packages using ANSIBLE

ADHOD :-
ADHOC
-> ansible all -a "yum install git"

-> ansible all -a "yum install maven"

-> ansible all -a "yum install docker"

-> anisble all -a "systemctl start docker"




STEPS FOR INSTALLING ANSIBLE: -

1. Create 3 Instances on AWS - LINUX

2. Create a Project ID on Control Node
-> useradd thinkly
-> passwd thinkly
# Entered the password

3. Add the USERADD inside the sudoers file
-> cd /etc/
-> vi sudoers
-> thinkly  ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD: ALL

4. Enable Password Authentication in the sshd_config file
-> Enabled Password Authentication
-> Enabled PermitRootLogin #
Restart the sshd
-> systemctl restart sshd
5. Create the users on slave nodes1 and node2,
-> add the users on sudoers file 
-> enable password authentication @


6. Generate the key on the COntrol Node
-> ssh-keygen
-> cd /home/thinkly/.ssh/
 

7. We copied the key and did SSH to the Slave-node1 and slave-node2
-> ssh-copy-id thinkly@172.31.37.98
-> ssh 'thinkly@172.31.37.98'

8. Install the ANSIBLE & PYTHON-PIP on CONTROL NODE 
-> sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y
-> sudo yum install python-pip
-> ansible --version
9. Add the IP ADDRESS of SLAVE-1 and SLAVE-2 in the hosts file of ANSIBLE
-> cd /etc/ansible
-> sudo chown -R thinkly:thinkly *
-> vi hosts
Add the IP ADDRESS of slave-1 and slave-2 

10. Ping the slave servers and test the connection using ANSIBLE ping
-> ansible all -m ping
-> vi ansible.cfg
interpreter_python      = /usr/bin/python
inventory      = /etc/ansible/hosts
-> ansible all -m ping

11. Two Approaches for installing on Worker-nodes

-> ansible all -a yum install git -y
b) Ansible Playbook

12. Install on slave nodes adhoc method 
-> ansible all -a "yum install -y git" --become
-> ansible all -i hosts -m copy -a 'src=file123.txt dest=/home/thinkly


13. Playbook method in ANSIBLE
-hosts: all
-task :
	-name : Installation of GIT on the server
	yum : name=git state=present


	-name : Installation of Maven on the server
	yum : name=maven state=present

	-name : Installation of APACHE on the server
	yum : name=httpd state=start
