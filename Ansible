STEPS for the Configuration of CONTROL and WORKER NODES

1. Create 3 EC2 Instances
-> Make one as Control node and other two servers as worker-1 and worker-2

2. Login to the COntrol node and make the changes in sshd_config
-> cd /etc/ssh
-> ll
-> vi sshd_config
# PasswordAuthentication yes (Enable)

3. Restart the sshd
-> systemctl restart sshd

4. Install ANSIBLE and Python-pip on the CONTROL NODE
-> amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y
-> yum install python python-pip python-dlevel -y

5. Add the IP address of the Worker-nodes in the Ansible-hosts file which is present on Control Node
-> cd /etc/ansible
-> ll
-> vi hosts
# ADD the IP addresses of both the Worker-nodes

6. Two Approaches for installing packages/running services

a) Install softwares/packages using ADHOC Commands (manually)
b) Install softwares/packages using ANSIBLE

ADHOD :-
ADHOC
-> ansible all -a "yum install git"

-> ansible all -a "yum install maven"

-> ansible all -a "yum install docker"

-> anisble all -a "systemctl start docker"
