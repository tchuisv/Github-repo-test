Docker: Open source tool used to create containers

Container: software/code user to package applications

JAR File problem
Using MAven we create JAR file (Application code) but not the environment

Why do we need containers
Scalable, fast and easy to manage, Portability

Monolithic -> Multiple servuice running on a single server
Micro service ->  Multiple service running on multiple services

Containers can be used as servers


Docker Architecture

CLIENT - Build Pull Run

DOCKER HOST - Docker Daemon (container and image)

        docker run container-name (create container using the pulled image)

    2. Install the required pacakages inside the container
        install mvn
        install git
        install my-sql
        install apache

    3. Run the application inside the container
